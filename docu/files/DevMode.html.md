Now that you have created your builder module, you can enable Developer Mode. After enabling this mode, link the Builder to your local module that you created in the last section. This connection makes it possible to begin previewing the HMTL and adding navigation nodes to your module directly in the Builder. You cannot yet call APIs.<br>

**Enable Developer Mode**

To enable Developer Mode take the following steps:

1. Navigate to the project home page and click <b>Development</b>. 
2. Switch Developer Mode on. A dark gray action bar appears at the bottom of the screen from which you can access <b>Settings</b> or exit Developer Mode.
3. Click <b>Settings</b> on the action bar.
4. To show the locally developed Builder module, switch on the toggle <b>Show local module</b>.
5. Enter the URL that points to your module that is running locally. For example, ``https://localhost:8081/builder/module.json``
6. The module is now available for preview. You can begin to develop and test your module in Developer Mode. <br><br>

**Test the behavior of your module**

By switching the scopes of the module on and off, you can test the behavior of your module at various levels of authorization. Access the scopes of your local module by opening <b>Settings from the gray action bar.</b> Under <b>Scopes</b> you can use the toggles to turn the various scopes on and off.
