Builder CLI 2.0.0 has been released.

Following a major refactoring of the Builder, the Builder CLI has now been adjusted to reflect those changes.

Most of these changes are transparent to the user, but some things need your attention:

* Builder Module authentication has been moved to the command line.
* You can now simulate a session language.
* The Builder's Help-Mode, Dirty-State, and Draft-Handling capabilities are now fully supported.
